RegJump
=======

A simple Power Shell script to jump to a specific registry key.


## Usage

The script works by opening the registry editor with the reg key in the clipboard, so all you have to do is:
* copy the registry key and 
* open the bat file Run PS Script.

A batch file is used to launch the Power Shell script, since on many computers either running scripts (like Power Shell, VBscript, Javascript) is turned off or you would have to open the Power Shell terminal and manually running the PS script which is two steps too many! :expressionless:
